title: "Judging criteria"
---

Your submission will be judged on three criteria that reflect different aspects of a complete health data science analysis pipeline:

1. Analytic approach
1. Surveillance quality
1. Communication of results

The table below breaks down some of the things you should consider for each domain.

+------------------------+--------+---------------------------------------------------+
| Domain                 | Weight | Things to consider                                |
+========================+========+===================================================+
| Analytic approach      | ⅓      | - Data cleaning and preparation                   |
|                        |        | - Choice and implementation of analytic method    |
|                        |        | - Code and reproducibility                        |
+------------------------+--------+---------------------------------------------------+
| Surveillance quality   | ⅓      | - Timely response to outbreaks in new data        |
|                        |        | - Specific to location and disease                |
|                        |        | - No false alarms                                 |
+------------------------+--------+---------------------------------------------------+
| Communication of results  | ⅓      | - Presentation of results (tables/visualisations) |
|                        |        | - Oral presentation                               |
|                        |        | - Translation potential                           |
