## What is it?

A two-day datathon where teams will work together to analyse a HIV medications dataset. Participants will develop a full data science pipeline---from research question to analytic output---with prizes awarded for the best submission. 

## When is it?

-   **Friday 29 November**, 3pm-5pm: Online introductory session
<div style = "font-size: 0.8em; font-weight:100;">

A limited number of travel bursaries of up to $300 are available to support participants who wish to attend the event but are travelling from outside of Sydney. The EOI form (linked below) includes an option to indicate whether you wish to apply for a travel bursary. Applicants will be asked to provide their enrolment status and the destination from where they will be travelling from.  

## Where is it?

## The data

Participants will analyse real-world data on infectious disease alerts from EPIWATCH (https://www.epiwatch.org/about), UNSW’s AI-driven open-source outbreak observatory. Founded by global leader in infectious diseases, Professor Raina MacIntyre, The EPIWATCH ‘Global Eye’ provides a wide variety of data generated around the world 24/7 through its AI-driven data collection including news casts, social platforms and medical reporting. 

## The datathon

### The online introductory session (Friday 29th November)

This is a chance to start interacting with your team, learn a bit more about the dataset and start thinking about potential research questions. Guest experts will give introductory talks on the EPIWATCH data.  

Team membership will be confirmed before the online introductory event and teams will be given a mini-activity to complete in the week leading up to the main event. 


### The main event (Thursday 5th and Friday 6th December)

Participants will work together in teams of four to propose a research question and develop and implement a data science pipeline to address the research question. There is no restriction on choice of software or type of research questions. The final product could be an interactive visualisation, a predictive analysis, a risk factor analysis, time series analysis, etc. Experts in HIV medications and data analysis will be in the room to help participants develop their research question and solution. At the end of the day, each team will present their research question and solution. Prizes will be awarded to the best submissions, evaluated by a panel of experts. Selected submissions may be included in a showcase and published on the CBDRH website or other suitable platform. 

Lunch and morning tea and coffee will be provided for in-person participants. Dietary requirements can be noted in the EOI form.
