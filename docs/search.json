The system provides near real-time monitoring for a range of infectious diseases and syndromes by scanning multiple curated and non-curated online news sources, including the WHO, CDC and Google News.\nEach record in the dataset represents a news article mentioning an infectious disease or syndrome. Minimum data includes the disease or syndrome(s) in question, the timing and location of the report, as well as the title and link to original online article.\nYou can learn more about EPIWATCH at epiwatch.org/products and read about the potential for AI-based digital surveillance to act as automated early warning systems in MacIntyre et al. (2023)."

At a minimum, you (or someone on your team) should be able to read in a dataset and do some basic data cleaning and summarisation using any software package of your choice. Effective teams combine members with different skill sets: epidemiological thinking is just as important as coding and algorithms. You also need someone on your team who can present and communicate your approach to the judging panel."

To emulate real-time surveillance we will release daily data in 15 minute increments: your aim is to notify authorities of the next outbreak before it gets out of control. There is no restriction on choice of software or analytic approach. At the end of the day, each team will present their research question and solution. Prizes will be awarded to the best submissions, evaluated by a panel of experts.

This event saw the participation of 22 HDS students working in six teams, five on campus and one hybrid online/on-campus team. The event focused on the Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV dataset, and teams were challenged to pose a research question and develop a solution using their health context expertise and analytic skills.\n\n\n\nHealth Data Science students in action 💛  Credit: Cassandra Hannagan \n\n\nFive experts were on hand to guide the teams, aiding them in crafting and executing their research questions and proposed solutions effectively. This included applied researchers with content expertise in HIV medications and machine learning, and Health Informaticians from NSW Health Sydney Local Health District\n\n\n\nConsulting with machine learning experts. 💛  Credit: Cassandra Hannagan \n\n\nThe datathon wasn’t just about coding and data; it was also about enjoyment and camaraderie. The teams enjoyed good food and had loads of fun. The presentations from all teams were highly engaging, with everyone putting into practice the technical coding skills and health context expertise from the HDS program.\n\n\n\nStudents presenting their work 💛  Credit: Cassandra Hannagan \n\n\nThe day culminated with a prize ceremony to acknowledge the hard work from all of the teams, and of course announce the winners! The winning team’s breakthrough came from using neural networks to predict the success of current ART drug combinations for patients with HIV. The second-place team used survival analysis to answer the question, “What drug combination is most effective at achieving viral suppression?” The third team investigated the impact of Dolutegravir (DTG) as a third agent drug on time to viral suppression among active HIV patients under antiretroviral therapy (ART).\nThis event truly blended learning, collaboration, and fun, capturing the true essence of data science in an enjoyable and rewarding environment."

This is a synthetic dataset that has been developed using Generative Adversarial Networks. This approach provides realistically complex data, allowing users to prototype, evaluate, and compare machine learning algorithms without the usual constraints of patient privacy.\n\n\nThe ART HIV dataset included demographic details and longitudinal clinical data on drug combinations and CD4 counts for nearly 9,000 patients. Common baseline drug regimes included tenofovir disoproxil & emtricitabine (FTC+TDF) and abacavir & lamivudine (3TC+ABC) Several of the teams choose to implement machine learning models to predict future CD4 outcomes based on previous values, demographics and treatment values."
